# Pinterest-like Image Marketplace

Full-stack Pinterest-inspired image sharing platform — FastAPI + Vue 3 — extended with **roles & audit**, a **Job Market**, a **pin-license Marketplace** (SePay), and an **Admin Ops** console.

Built to practice production-shaped backend patterns: REST, GraphQL, realtime, Celery, multi-store data, CSRF/session cookies, and sprint-based delivery with smoke scripts.

## What shipped (product domains)

| Domain | Status | Highlights |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **Core social** | Live | Pins, boards, likes, comments, search, profiles, follows, chat (WebSocket), notifications (SSE), recommendations |
| **Phase 0 — trust** | CLOSED | User roles (`admin` / `artist` / `employer` / `seller`), ownership checks, append-only audit log |
| **Job Market** | CLOSED | Company KYC / hiring rights, credentials, job posts, applications + CV, work-experience approval, JD reports & company suspend |
| **Marketplace** | CLOSED | Seller eligibility gate, watermarked preview / signed original ACL, listings, payout methods, SePay orders, copyright reports + license certificates |
| **Admin Ops** | CLOSED (MVP) | Vue `/admin` shell: roles, audit, content moderation, KYC queue, credentials override, job reports, copyright (resolve → unlist), work-exp queue |

## Quick start (Docker)

```bash
docker network create pinterest-network   # once
cp .env.example .env                      # fill secrets; see Marketplace / SePay notes
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Frontend | http://localhost:3000 |
| API / health | http://localhost:8000/health |
| Swagger | http://localhost:8000/docs |
| Mailhog | http://localhost:8025 |
| PgAdmin | http://localhost:5050 |

Migrations run with the app image / entrypoint as configured in Compose. After code pulls, restart `fastapi-container` if reload did not pick up changes.

### Grant admin (local)

```bash
docker exec -w /fastapi -e PYTHONPATH=/fastapi fastapi-container \
  python scripts/grant_admin.py <username>
```

Then log out / in so the Vue store reloads roles. Open http://localhost:3000/admin (shield icon in the aside).

### Smoke tests (examples)

```bash
docker exec -w /fastapi -e PYTHONPATH=/fastapi fastapi-container \
  python scripts/smoke_admin_sprint4.py
```

Other smokes: `scripts/smoke_phase0_*.py`, `smoke_jobmarket_*.py`, `smoke_marketplace_*.py`, `smoke_admin_sprint1–3.py`. Marketplace SePay smoke needs `DEV_MODE=true` and `MP_SEPAY_MOCK=true`.

## Async processing

Celery handles non-blocking work such as pin preview / content hash, email, and marketplace order TTL cancellation:

```
API request → Redis/RabbitMQ broker → Celery worker → DB / mail / media
```
